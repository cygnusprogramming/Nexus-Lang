## Introduction

Nexus is not just another programming language; it's a testament to the boundless creativity and innovation that can emerge from young minds. Developed by a 13-year-old, Nexus stands out
 as a project that combines the simplicity of Python with the ambition of creating something entirely new.

## What is Nexus?

Nexus is an interpreted language built on top of Python. It aims to make programming more accessible and fun, especially for beginners and young learners. By leveraging Python's robust
ness and readability, Nexus introduces new syntax and constructs that encourage creative problem-solving and experimentation.

## Key Features

- **Simplicity**: Designed with ease of use in mind, Nexus makes programming concepts approachable for everyone, regardless of their prior experience.
- **Creativity**: Encourages users to think outside the box with its unique syntax and features that promote innovative solutions.
- **Interpreted Language**: Built on Python, Nexus inherits Python's efficiency and readability while offering a fresh perspective on programming.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in making Nexus better. Whether you have ideas for new features, want to improve documentation, or help fix bugs, your input is valuable.
 Please refer to our CONTRIBUTING guide for details on how to get involved.

## License

Nexus is open-source software released under the MIT License. This means you can use, modify, and distribute the software freely, subject to the terms of the license.

Thank you for taking an interest in Nexus. We hope it inspires you as much as it did its creator!

## Installation

To install Nexus, I reccommend using the installer. Download the Nexus installer from <a href="https://github.com/hawk-Codes/Nexus-Lang/releases/tag/v0.1-Installer">here</a>.

After that, add the installation directory to PATH. The default installation directory is C:\Program Files (x86)\Nexus

To add your installation directory to PATH, follow these steps:

- Open windows search.
- Search "Edit System Environment Variables"
- Open the app.
- Click on "Environment Variables"
- You will see two boxes. In the box that says "System Variables" click on "Path".
- Click on Edit.
- Click on new.
- Add the installation directory and exit by clicking "OK."

## Usage

After adding the installation directory for Nexus to PATH, open command prompt or any other shell.

Enter a command saying "nx".

Nexus will launch.

## Additional Information

To run a file in which your Nexus code exists, type "run C:/path/to/your/file.nx" inside the Nexus interpeter.

To change the command that launches Nexus, edit the name of the batch file (nx.bat) to the command you want to launch Nexus from. Example:

- Let's say I want to change the command so that Nexus launches from the command ":nexus".
- Open the installation directory.
- Click on the file "nx.bat".
- Press F2 on your keyboard.
- Rename the file to ":nexus".
- Now whenever I type ":nexus" in the shell, it will launch Nexus.
